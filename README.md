# Advent README 

## Description
I’m doing Advent of Code for fun this year, solving one challenge each day while also trying a new tea every day (I have "tea advent calendar"!). I'm using this as a way to learn new programming languages, explore various dev environments (currently using Neovim) and improve my problem-solving skills. Check out my stats below!
